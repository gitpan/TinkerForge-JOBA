TinkerForge version 0.1
========================

This module provides a perl binding to the TinkerForge hardware. It uses
the C-API provided by TinkerForge and wraps it for perl usage.

Since it wraps the C-API you need a C compiler to build this module.

For now there are only a few bricklets supported (only those I have access to
an can test with) and only the polling interface (but the callbacks are planned
for 0.2)

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

You will need some TinkerForge hardware :-)
